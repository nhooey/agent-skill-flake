# Build the outputs of a per-repo `skills-devshell/` sub-flake: one
# `mkCombination` (the dev shell's entire skill set, owned by a single
# reconcile appName) surfaced as runnable apps plus a re-composable source.
#
# The pattern: a repo drops a `skills-devshell/` sub-flake whose `outputs` is
# just a call to this, listing the skill sources it wants in its dev shell. The
# repo's ROOT devShell then invokes the apps at RUNTIME
# (`nix run "$PRJ_ROOT/skills-devshell#reconcile" -- --scope=project`) — see
# `devshell-skills-hook.nix` for that wiring. Because the sub-flake is invoked
# at runtime and never declared as a root input, the skill sources live only in
# THIS sub-flake's lock: the root keeps a clean input graph (a true leaf with
# zero skill inputs) and transitive consumers of the root never drag the skill
# mesh in. One combination means one `purge` (or `reap`) removes the whole set
# in a single command.
